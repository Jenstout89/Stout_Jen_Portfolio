WK 2: Call to Action - Failure to Success



Lego Rises to the Top…Again

When I found out I needed to write about a success story I instantly thought of a documentary I watched a few weeks ago, A Lego Brickumentary. While the documentary began with how Lego was born in 1958, they also shared with the viewer how Lego were near bankruptcy in 2004 after a five year ongoing struggle in which they were losing $1 million dollars per day. In the article “How Lego came back from the brink of bankruptcy” written by R. Feloni, she states that the one reason Lego stayed above water was due to the introduction in 1999 of a new Star Wars building kit series. Without the introduction of the Star Wars series Lego would have went belly up far before 2004.
	
It wasn’t until 2004 that Lego saw the light at the end of the bankruptcy tunnel. This light was the introduction of Jorgan Vig Knudstrop as the new CEO. Knudstrop knew Lego needed to make some major changes, one of which was to cut the number of different brick being manufactured from 12,000 to 6,000. Making a 50% reduction not only cut costs, but would also make the building kits much easier for consumers of all ages to build. He also recognized that Lego was lacking the input of their most avid builders and consumers. Upon this revelation, the new CEO added many avid builders to the staff as a panel of judges and also as designers to help make products that consumers of all generations would be interested in. 
	
I love Lego as a success story, not because of how they started or the beginning of their success, but because when the worst came to worst, they fought back to the top again. They recognized cost cutting was essential and how they needed to listen to the builders.

So where is Lego now? Lego debuted the Lego Movie on February 07, 2014. It has grossed nearly $500 billion dollars worldwide, not including digital or home video. As a follow up to the first successful movie, Lego is also introducing a Lego Batman movie in 2017 and Lego movie sequel in 2018. In addition, Lego has also introduced several new build kits including Disney princesses, city, DC Comics and several others of which will appeal to several generations regardless of gender. Lego also has numerous branded animated television shows, non-theatrical released films, video games and toy crossovers.

In conclusion, it is my opinion Lego turned their company around so that it can be around for several more generations to come. After all, investing in Lego build kits has been a better investment than gold this century.
