WK 4: Project and Portfolio

Week four was a huge step into getting back to normal. I felt less sad this week and more focused on school and going back to work after being off for two weeks with family. I was completing assignment with confidence like I did not have before I started this class. I found that my strongest personal brand trait would have to be perseverance. No matter what I have been through in my life I have always been able to pick up the pieces, mold it to help me become a better person, designer, and now developer. I have also seen just useful the Project & Portfolio classes will be in the months to come at Full Sail. I knew going into these two classes that I wanted to do well and gain a wealth of knowledge, but I learned that I need to have the sturdiest strongest foundation I could possible build. I also needed to be honest with myself on what I was lacking in and what I could improve upon. It was through these two traits, perseverance and honesty, that I have succeeded in my book no matter what I have gained and grown as much as I can in this month.
