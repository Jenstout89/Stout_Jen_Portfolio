WK 2: Anchor Points

What have you done?
Week two could be my toughest week playing catchup after the sudden death of my sister only one week ago today. I have tried to keep up, but naturally planning and attending all of the events of the week I fell behind a bit. I have taken an additional week off work to help amend this so I can grieve and spend time with family, but also to help focus on school and get back on track. Getting back on track this week will help to make the last two weeks of these classes shape out nicely. I have made a plan for how I will attack each day and get the past work and future work done diligantly.
What are you doing?
Currently I am working on each assignment for the PAP class. Since last week we covered any of these assignments I feel I have a great grasp on how to complete each assignment to its fullest and also challenge myself to make it better than the previous week.
Whatâ€™s next?
The next item after I complete the past and current weeks assignments for the PAP class I am working toward the career module class. I would like to go into week three being current and up to date on all assignments for both classes so I could have any questions answered for week four. Having any questions answered before the class end would help me to think about each class between this PAP and career module class and the next much differently than before taking them. I would be able to think about how I could document and incorperate each assignment into my future portfolio. 
How to?
I would like my how to focus this week to be which type of portfolio I would like to start on in the up coming months. I have used both physical and eportfolios in the past, but I am unsure of which type of portfolio would be the best fit for the mobile development world.
