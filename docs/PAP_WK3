WK 3: Week in Review


I have to say that week three was a busy week for me. I finished catching up on past assignments, while trying to get ahead a little bit. I do feel more confident with the tasks with the tasks we are given as the weeks go on. I can see personal growth and knowledge of my personal branding such as in my research and knowledge or different topics. Before week three I did not have an inspirational quote or phrase now I have a few that have stuck with me through my research. 
I have had a chance to look over my Linkedin page and improve it in ways in which I did not notice before these classes. I did receive some advice on how I could make a few more weeks and I immediately went to research and change it accordingly. I also enjoyed the feedback on the anchor point’s assignment and the call to action – encouragement. I was afraid to share that much about myself with newer people, but after reading some of the other posts I realized I was not alone in personal struggles. I hope a few of the same people will be with me throughout the course of other Project & Portfolio classes because I have really enjoyed the feedback and knowledgeable posts.
